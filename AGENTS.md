## Fork Desktop Launch Guardrail

This checkout is Milad's fork. The only canonical desktop app for normal use and user-visible verification is:

```text
/Applications/T3 Code (Fork Alpha).app
```

- **Never launch** `apps/desktop/scripts/start-electron.mjs`, `.electron-runtime/T3 Code (Dev).app`, or any app named `T3 Code (Dev)` unless Milad explicitly asks for a source/dev run.
- **Never activate by generic app name** (`open -a "T3 Code (Alpha)"` or AppleScript by name). A separate upstream/legacy app exists at `/Applications/T3 Code (Alpha).app` and does not contain this fork's changes.
- Use the full Fork Alpha path above for opening/activating. Before reporting an app launch as complete, verify its process path begins with `/Applications/T3 Code (Fork Alpha).app`.
- Subagents must not launch desktop applications or dev servers unless their assignment explicitly requires it. The primary agent owns packaged-app launch and end-to-end validation.
- Fork artifact source: `release/local-alpha-icons/T3-Code-0.0.28-arm64.dmg`. Do not overwrite the legacy `/Applications/T3 Code (Alpha).app`; rebuild and update the separately named Fork Alpha app only with explicit scope.

`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file, so these guardrails apply to Claude sessions and subagents opened from this repository.

## Task Completion Requirements

- Keep local verification focused on the files and packages changed. Run the smallest relevant test set; do not run the full workspace test suite as a routine completion step.
  - Use `vp test run <test-files>` for focused built-in Vite+ tests. Use `vp run test` only when the affected package specifically requires its `test` script.
  - Backend changes must include and run focused tests for the changed behavior.
  - Run targeted formatting, lint, and type checks for the affected scope when available.
- Do not run repo-wide `vp check`, `vp run typecheck`, `vp run test`, or equivalent full-suite commands locally unless the user explicitly requests them. CI is responsible for the full verification suite.
- After frontend feature development or any user-visible frontend behavior change, the primary agent must run one integrated verification pass for each affected client surface after integrating the work:
  - Web: use the `test-t3-app` skill. Launch one isolated environment, authenticate through the printed pairing URL, and verify the affected flow in the controlled browser.
  - Mobile: use the `test-t3-mobile` skill. Connect one representative iOS Simulator or Android Emulator available on the host to one isolated environment and verify the affected flow. On compatible macOS hosts, prefer iOS for cross-platform changes and stream it through serve-sim in the T3 Code in-app browser or another available agent browser; use Android when it is the affected or viable platform.
  - Subagents must not independently launch dev servers or repeat integrated client verification unless their delegated task explicitly requires it.
  - Stop dev servers, watchers, and other long-running verification processes when the focused verification is complete.

## Package Roles

- `apps/server`: Node.js WebSocket server. Wraps Codex app-server (JSON-RPC over stdio), serves the React web app, and manages provider sessions.
- `apps/web`: React/Vite UI. Owns session UX, conversation/event rendering, and client-side state. Connects to the server via WebSocket.
- `packages/contracts`: Shared effect/Schema schemas and TypeScript contracts for provider events, WebSocket protocol, and model/session types. Keep this package schema-only — no runtime logic.
- `packages/shared`: Shared runtime utilities consumed by both server and client applications. Uses explicit subpath exports (e.g. `@t3tools/shared/git`) — no barrel index.
- `packages/client-runtime`: Shared runtime package for sharing client code across web and mobile.

## Reference Repos

- Open-source Codex repo: https://github.com/openai/codex

Use these as implementation references when designing protocol handling, UX flows, and operational safeguards.

## Vendored Repositories

This project vendors external repositories under `.repos/` as read-only reference material for coding
agents.

- Prefer examples and patterns from the vendored source code over generated guesses or web search results.
- Do not edit files under `.repos/` unless explicitly asked.
- Do not import from `.repos/`; application code must continue importing from normal package dependencies.
- Manage vendored subtrees with `vpr sync:repos`; use `vpr sync:repos --repo <id>` to sync one configured repository.
- When updating a dependency with a configured vendored subtree, sync that subtree in the same change so
  `.repos/` matches the installed dependency version.
- When writing Effect code, read `.repos/effect-smol/LLMS.md` first and inspect `.repos/effect-smol/` for
  examples of idiomatic usage, tests, module structure, and API design.
- When writing relay infrastructure code with Alchemy, inspect `.repos/alchemy-effect/` for examples of
  idiomatic usage, tests, module structure, and API design.
